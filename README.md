# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + ant design

## Using pnpm or yarn

**We recommend using npm or yarn to install**，it not only makes development easier，but also allow you to take advantage of the rich ecosystem of Javascript packages and tooling.

```bash
$ npm install ant-design-lz --save
```

```bash
$ yarn add ant-design-lz
```

If you are in a bad network environment，you can try other registries and tools like [cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm).
